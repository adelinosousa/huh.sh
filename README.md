## Encrypted anonymous messaging
HUH.SH uses End-to-End Encryption ( E2EE ) 🔒 to safeguard your privacy and online safety. E2EE prevents messages sent from being read or modified during transition to the end user. In short, prevents evesdroping on your messages (including from HUH.SH). Users are generated dynamically on the client to ensure anonymity. Messages sent and received are cleared once the user disconnects. Data is keep in memory to prevent hijacking and allow easy disposal. No cookies, logs or client side analytics exist. Server data is store in its encrypted form and disposed of once all users leave a particular "room".
